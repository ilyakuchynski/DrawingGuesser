## Description:
DrawingGuesser is an interactive game that puts your drawing skills to the ultimate test. Players must race against the clock to accurately depict a given topic or word on a canvas, while AI should be able to decipher player's drawing.
Each round player is given a topic and they try to draw it in the allotted time. Player succeeds if the AI guesser correctly defines what's drawn. For such AI assistant we use GPT-4 api. 
Another interesting option is to see what other players have drawn. You can choose a topic and see all the correct paintings done by users just like you.

## Technologies:
